# Calculate-Triangle-Area

A simple program to calculate the area of a triangle based on user-provided base and height.

## 📝 Description

This program takes the base and height of a triangle as input to calculate its area. It includes validation to ensure that the input values are positive integers.

The formula used for the calculation is: **Area = 0.5 * base * height**

## 🎯 Problem Statement

**Input:** 
- The base of the triangle.
- The height of the triangle.

**Output:** The area of the triangle.

**Rules:**
- The base and height must be integers greater than 0.
- The program should handle invalid input (e.g., negative numbers, zero, or non-integer values).

## 💡 Examples

### Example 1
```
Input:
10
5

Output:
25.0
```
Explanation: Area = 0.5 * 10 * 5 = 25.0

### Example 2
```
Input:
8
10

Output:
40.0
```
Explanation: Area = 0.5 * 8 * 10 = 40.0

### Example 3
```
Input:
-5
10

Output:
(Error message, e.g., "Base and height must be positive numbers.")
```
Explanation: The input -5 is invalid, so the program should not produce a calculation.
